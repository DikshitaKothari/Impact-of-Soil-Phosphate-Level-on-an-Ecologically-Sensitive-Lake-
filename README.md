# Impact-of-Soil-Phosphate-Level-on-an-Ecologically-Sensitive-Lake
In this study, the impact of soil phosphate level in a section of the Murrumbidgee River is examined. The river empties into an ecologically sensitive lake. A dam separates the river and the lake to prevent the lake from becoming polluted. 

The 2019-2020 fire season in Australia was one of the worst on record. Known as `The Black
Summer', an estimated 300,000 square kilometers of bushland was burnt. An important ecological effect of
fires is a change in soil phosphate level. Phosphate is a problem if it leaches into waterways.
Therefore, the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment has set maximum limits of
100 microgram per litre for a river and 50 microgram per litre for lakes.

Analytical and numerical solutions of the Difussion Equation have been derived and used to decipher the effect of the phosphate levels on a river which empties into an ecologically sensitive lake.
